# Future-Functions-Challenge-1

The Tribunal holds a conference in a room with n seats placed in X rows, each row having Y seats. The values for X and Y are inputs. Each of the n seats is assigned a random number in the range 1, n. 

When a citizen enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person. If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number and which also maximizes the number of students that can take the exam. If no one is in the room, then the citizen sits at seat number 1. 

Design a program that simulates the mentioned conference room.

Design a simple yet efficient interface to use the program in real life situations.
